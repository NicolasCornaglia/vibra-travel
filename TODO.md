To setup the schedule dates for the calendar section, you have to enter to info@vibra-travel.com,
go to the create button on the top left side of the screen, and click on the last button (agenda de citas, scheduler)
On it, it will open a popup with the already created Free Consultation calendar, look for the pencil icon on add avvailability
and click on it. Inside, the Date scheduler opens and you can add availability. Go to General availibility and in the dropdown
select the last option(custom). There, you can add for every week with the times and dates for the week you see on the left panel
Go to next and save. Important to know. If you set the days to be available to schedule to 60 lets say, any appointments you create
 for later than 60 days wont show for now, but will be displayed in the future
