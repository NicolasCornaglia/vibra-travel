As an avid padel player, I’ve seen firsthand how this dynamic sport has become one of the fastest-growing in the world. With years of experience organizing work placements and cultural experiences for groups, I understand what makes a trip to Spain truly special—whether it’s finding the best spots for padel, immersing in local culture, or creating memorable moments that blend sport and leisure. That’s why I started my padel experience company—to combine my expertise with my passion and offer unforgettable sports-focused experiences in Spain."
